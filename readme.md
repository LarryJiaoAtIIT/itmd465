1. Simple Calculator

A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. This calculator requires the user to have two integers to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It does not retain the history of its calculations, but does allow you to reset the values that you have put in. Please do not divide by zero. 

2.  DOM Manipulator
 
 A DOM Manipulation lab, where when given two text inputs and an option pane, the output truly rattles your soul! The old saying goes that you should think outside the box, but maybe it's time to head back inside, and reminisce back on where you came from.
